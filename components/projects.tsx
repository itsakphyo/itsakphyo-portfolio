        "Built a browser extension with a FastAPI backend that allows users to fact-check selected text or images directly from any webpage. The backend leverages Google Gemini, a large language model (LLM), for real-time claim verification, web search, and OCR-based image analysis. Includes multilingual support via Google Cloud Translate and is containerized with Docker for easy deployment.",

Each role has specific features and permissions tailored to their responsibilities. Due to the ongoing academic review, the source code and full documentation remain confidential.
