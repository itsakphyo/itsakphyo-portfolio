      description:
        "As part of my final year project, I developed a comprehensive translation platform with sophisticated role-based access control, featuring three distinct user types (Freelancer, QA Member, Admin) each with dedicated dashboards and permissions. Implemented a complete workflow system where Admins create translation jobs, Freelancers complete tasks, and QA Members perform quality assessment with acceptance metrics tracking. Built robust authentication with JWT, email verification, and role-specific password management flows. The platform includes an advanced appeal system allowing freelancers to challenge rejected translations with documentation upload capability. Database schema leverages SQLAlchemy ORM with efficient relationship mapping between users, tasks, and languages. Features multi-language system localization (English, Burmese, and regional dialects) to support linguistic diversity in Myanmar.",

        "Developed a comprehensive machine learning pipeline to classify fMRI brain activity data and predict music genres based on neural responses in the auditory cortex. Implemented end-to-end workflow through three structured Jupyter notebooks covering exploratory data analysis, systematic model comparison, and final model training. Processed 22,036 brain activity features from blood-oxygenation level measurements across 160 training samples spanning five music genres (Ambient, Country, Heavy Metal, Rock, Classical). Applied advanced feature engineering with SelectKBest feature selection, PCA dimensionality reduction, and statistical significance testing. Conducted comprehensive model evaluation comparing 9+ ML algorithms including Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and SVM with cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization. Built robust data preprocessing pipeline handling feature scaling, problematic feature identification, and proper CSV data loading without headers. Achieved systematic model performance tracking with metadata persistence and confidence scoring for final predictions on 40 test samples.",
